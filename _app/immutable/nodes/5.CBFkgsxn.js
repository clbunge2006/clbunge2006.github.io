            the PlayStation, with three main entries to the franchise. These games hold a
            special place for me, as they were a cornerstone of my early childhood. When
            I was young, my grandparents owned a PS3, and were the only ones in my family
            that had this game. Thus, wherever I think of LittleBigPlanet, I am reminded of
            those trips to Maine long ago.</p> <div class="flex items-center justify-center w-full h-80 mt-4"><img class="border-4 my-4 border-indigo-300 h-full svelte-hopac1" src="images/fanpage/story_wedding_05.jpg"/></div> <h6 class="text-blue-950 text-center text-sm font-display mt-4 mb-2 w-full"><a class="text-sky-600 underline underline-offset-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfFfdSRMpQs">A promotional screenshot</a>
          from the first LittleBigPlanet game.</h6> <p class="font-display text-lg leading-loose text-justify">The series has survived several generations of
            consoles, with the three main installments being playable on the PS3 through the
            PS5. Published by Sony, this game has passed through myriad game developers,
            having moved on to its eleventh studio by 2023. Indeed, such a varied development
            schedule has led to various problems with the game&#39;s long-term health. Though the
            game&#39;s tagline is “Play, Create, Share,” discontinuation of the game&#39;s official
            servers has diminished the game&#39;s status.</p> <div class="flex items-center justify-center w-full h-80 mt-4"><img class="border-4 my-4 border-indigo-300 h-full svelte-hopac1" src="images/fanpage/karting.jpg"/></div> <h6 class="text-blue-950 text-center text-sm font-display mt-4 mb-2 w-full">A photo of LittleBigPlanet Karting, a spinoff game which took the creative concepts of
            LittleBigPlanet and applied them to a karting platform. As a kid, I spent hours creating tracks
            for my siblings and I to race on, leading this game to hold a special place in my heart as well.</h6> <p class="font-display text-lg leading-loose text-justify">During its prime, sharing and playing 
            user-generated content was a mainstay of the LittleBigPlanet experience, with
            large parts of the community and content for the game being destroyed by Sony&#39;s
            decision to pull all official servers offline. Indeed, since the release of the
            third and final installment to the official series, LittleBigPlanet 3, the series
            has  entered into a long state of steady decline. By October 31st of this year,
            the final official installment to the series, LittleBigPlanet 3, will be delisted
            from the PS4 marketplace, along with all its DLC.</p> <div class="flex items-center justify-center w-full h-80 mt-4"><img class="border-4 my-4 border-indigo-300 h-full svelte-hopac1" src="images/fanpage/offline-1.jpg"/> <div class="w-8"></div> <img class="border-4 my-4 border-indigo-300 h-full svelte-hopac1" src="images/fanpage/offline-2.webp"/></div> <h6 class="text-blue-950 text-center text-sm font-display mt-4 mb-2 w-full">LittleBigPlanet 3, the final installment to the series, was removed from

            sentimental value for me, I am disheartened by Sony killing all official support
            for this game, despite the fans who were still very much invested in it. I hope
            that sometime in the future, someone else who is passionate about the game gets
            a chance to revive it, giving back to the community that supports and cherishes
            these games.</p> <div class="w-full my-4 h-0 border border-double border-black"></div> <div class="w-full flex items-center justify-center mb-4"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://gamerant.com/littlebigplanet-playstation-store-delisted-why/"><img src="images/fanpage/sackboyEarth.png" class="w-16 mt-4 hover:w-20 duration-300 svelte-hopac1"/></a></div></div>`;return{c(){a=c("link"),o=p(),t=c("div"),t.innerHTML=m,r=p(),s=c("div"),s.innerHTML=g,this.h()},l(e){const i=k("svelte-10tgsz5",document.head);a=f(i,"LINK",{rel:!0,href:!0}),i.forEach(l),o=u(e),t=f(e,"DIV",{id:!0,class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),y(t)!=="svelte-rvdjah"&&(t.innerHTML=m),r=u(e),s=f(e,"DIV",{class:!0,style:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),y(s)!=="svelte-pm7f4l"&&(s.innerHTML=g),this.h()},h(){document.title="LittleBigPlanet Fanpage",n(a,"rel","icon"),n(a,"href","images/favicon.png"),n(t,"id","lbp-header"),n(t,"class","sticky flex flex-col items-center justify-center w-full h-1/5 border-b-8 border-black svelte-hopac1"),n(s,"class","flex flex-col w-full h-full items-center justify-center"),P(s,"background-color","#c2cdd2")},m(e,i){L(document.head,a),h(e,o,i),h(e,t,i),h(e,r,i),h(e,s,i)},p:d,i:d,o:d,d(e){e&&(l(o),l(t),l(r),l(s)),l(a)}}}class I extends x{constructor(a){super(),w(this,a,null,_,b,{})}}export{I as component};
