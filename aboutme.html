                        from Cohasset, Massachusetts. I have lived most of my life in this town, 
                        having moved away from Lake Forest, Illinois, at the age of five. Some 
                        interests of mine include technology, coding, coastal studies, and rowing.
                        My jobs reflect these passions of mine, as I have worked as both a coxswain 
                        and shore manager at a local rowing club for the past two years, helping 
                        others experience the joys I have found in the sport.</p> <img class="w-5/6 h-auto mt-4 border-4 border-slate-700" src="images/blackburn.jpg"> <h6 class="text-gray-700 text-center text-sm font-display mt-4 mb-2 w-4/5">An image published by the Gloucester Times, showing me wearing the #2 jersey. Here, I am about
                        to set out on a 20-mile circumnavigation of Cape Ann, the longest race I have yet to row.</h6> <p class="leading-loose text-justify text-xl font-display">Another thing I have 
                        been involved with that reflects my interests is the Cohasset Center for Student Coastal Research, 
                        where I have also been involved throughout my highschool experience. Over this past summer, I spent 
                        much of my time developing an autonomous drone to take aerial scans of coastal regions, a project 
                        that combined several of my hobbies.</p> <iframe class="w-5/6 h-96 mt-4 border-4 border-slate-700" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_oRyzqE304E?si=xKp0uT6tvA1P039H" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe> <h6 class="text-gray-700 text-center text-sm font-display mt-4 mb-2 w-3/5">This is a film produced my a friend of mine, chronicling some of my work done at
                        CSCR.</h6> <p class="leading-loose text-justify text-xl font-display">Outside of rowing, I am also involved in my school&#39;s 
                        tennis team, where I play for varsity throughout the spring. Musically, 
                        I feel that I enjoy all genres,

                        at my music blog!</a>
                        
                        Here, I talk about my favorite albums, go into depth about
                        their histories and legacies, and give my rankings and opinions of my favorite
                        songs. I have two younger sisters, Schuyler and Phoebe, and live with both of
                        my parents and my maternal grandmother. I am hoping to get into a good college
                        over this coming school year, and hopefully enroll next fall!
