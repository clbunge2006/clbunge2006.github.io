        preceded by The College Dropout and Late Registration. I chose this album over the rest of Kanye&#39;s 
        extensive discography as I feel that though some of his albums may have better songs, such as Ghost 
        Town from ye or Runaway from My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, this album best showcases the talent 
        of Kanye&#39;s early years as an artist, while also having—in my opinion—the highest proportion of great 
        songs. Graduation also has my favorite album cover of any of Kanye&#39;s work: a contemporary Japanese 
        piece by the artist Takashi Murakami, whose other art I can find on some mugs in my own home. 
        Released on September 11th, 2007, this album serves as a transition piece from the more soulful 
        tunes of Kanye&#39;s first two albums to the more powerful music seen on 808s and Heartbreaks and My 
        Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. The song debuted at number one on Billboard&#39;s Top 200, selling 
        nearly a million copies in the first week of its release. It has since septupled these sales, 
        and has been certified as quintuple platinum. The hit single Stronger was also released with 
        this album, topping the Billboard Hot 100 in the US as well as 10 other countries. 
        In the years since its release, the album has gained considerable fame and been granted many 
        prestigious musical awards. The album has been included on Billboard&#39;s Top 500 albums of all time, 
        \though notably at a higher spot than Kanye&#39;s later My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, which currently 
        sits at #17 overall. Graduation also earned a Grammy for Best Rap Album of the Year, and was 
        nominated for the Best Album of the Year. Overall, I find the music on this album to be very good, 
        both on its own and in the context of Kanye&#39;s discography, showing a major transition in the sound 
        that he tries to cultivate.</p></div> <div class="h-full w-1/4 flex flex-col items-center justify-center "></div></div></div> <div id="landing" class="absolute flex items-center justify-center h-screen w-full duration-300"><div class="flex items-center justify-center h-1/2 w-7/12"><img id="graduationMainPage" src="images/graduation.jpg" alt="Kanye West's Graduation" style="height: 80%;"></div> </div>
